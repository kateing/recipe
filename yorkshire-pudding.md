Yorkshire Puddings (vegan)

## Ingredients
- 90g/3oz vegan margarine, eg Pure, Suma, Biona
- 1c flour, sieved 
- 1 tsp baking powder
- Pinch salt 
- 1c milk
- 1/4c whole egg replacer
- 1/4c water
 

## Instructions 
- Preheat the oven to 425°F.
- Put 1 tsp vegan margarine into each hole of a 9-hole bun tray.
- Mix the flour, baking powder and salt well. Mix the egg replacer into a smooth paste with the water then mix that in a jug with the soya milk.
- Place the bun tray in the oven for 10 minutes so it gets very hot.
- Add half the liquid containing egg replacer to the dry flour mix. Whisk to a smooth paste then incorporate the rest of the liquid until you have a smooth batter.
- Remove the bun tin from the oven and very quickly spoon the batter into each hole - it should sizzle. Return to the oven immediately and bake for 15-20 minutes.
