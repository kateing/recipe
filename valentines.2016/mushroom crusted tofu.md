## Ingredients
- 14 oz extra firm tofu, pressed (here’s how to press tofu, I wrap it in a kitchen towel, too.)
- Salsify
- seaweed Salad
- olive oil for cooking
- green onions, sliced

### For the marinade
- 3 tablespoons tamari (or soy sauce)
- 1 1/4 cups veggie broth
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

### For The Crust:
- 1 oz dried porcini mushrooms
- 1/4 cup fine bread crumbs
- Pinch each tarragon, rosemary, thyme crushed with your fingers
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- Several dashes fresh black pepper
- 1 clove garlic, finely minced


## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 400°F.
- Slice the tofu into 8 even slices widthwise. Slice each of those diagonally
  corner to corner so that you have long triangles.
- Mix together marinade ingredients in a large bowl and marinate the tofu for
  at least an hour and up to 8 hours, turning when you can.
- When tofu is ready, prepare the crusting mixture. In a blender, pulse the
  porcinis until they’re powdery. Now toss them in a wide bowl along with the
  breadcrumbs, herbs, salt, pepper and garlic. Reserve 1/4 cup of the mixture to use in the sauce.

### Roast Salsify
- In medium bowl, toss salsify with oil, salt and pepper.
- Spread onto baking sheet and roast (400°F) until tender, about 30 minutes.

### Now cook the tofu:
- Preheat a large, heavy bottomed pan over medium high heat.
- In the meantime, dredge half the tofu slices in the breadcrumb mixture and place on a plate.
- Pour a thin layer of oil in the pan and cook the dredged tofu slices on each
  side for about 4 minutes each, until golden brown. Use a thin metal spatula
  (as thin as possible) so that you can easily get under the tofu to flip it.
  A thick spatula might cause the breading to fall off.
- While the first batch is cooking, dredge the second batch.
- Keep cooked tofu warm by placing on a plate and covering with tin foil.

- Serve over roasted salsify, garnished with scallions and additional herbs
